# Preservation of (co)limits in the functor category

Show that if `X ⨯ -` preserves colimits in `D` for any `X : D`, then the product functor `F ⨯ -`
for `F : C ⥤ D` preserves colimits.

The idea of the proof is simply that products and colimits in the functor category are computed
pointwise, so pointwise preservation implies general preservation.

If `X × -` preserves colimits in `D` for any `X : D`, then the product functor `F ⨯ -` for
`F : C ⥤ D` also preserves colimits.

Note this is (mathematically) a special case of the statement that
"if limits commute with colimits in `D`, then they do as well in `C ⥤ D`"
but the story in Lean is a bit more complex, and this statement isn't directly a special case.
That is, even with a formalised proof of the general statement, there would still need to be some
work to convert to this version: namely, the natural isomorphism
`(evaluation C D).obj k ⋙ prod.functor.obj (F.obj k) ≅ prod.functor.obj F ⋙ (evaluation C D).obj k`
